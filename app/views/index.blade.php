			<h3>What is professional coaching?</h3>
			<p>International Coach Federation (ICF) defines coaching as partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential, which is particularly important in todayâ€™s uncertain and complex environment. Coaches honor the client as the expert in his or her life and work and believe every client is creative, resourceful and whole. Standing on this foundation, the coach's responsibility is to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Discover, clarify, and align with what the client wants to achieve</li>
				<li>Encourage client self-discovery</li>
				<li>Elicit client-generated solutions and strategies</li>
				<li>Hold the client responsible and accountable</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This process helps clients dramatically improve their outlook on work and life, while improving their leadership skills and unlocking their potential.</p>

			<h3>What are some typical reasons someone might work with a coach?</h3>
			<p>An individual or team might choose to work with a coach for many reasons, including but not limited to the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Something urgent, compelling or exciting is at stake (a challenge, stretch goal or opportunity)</li>
				<li>A gap exists in knowledge, skills, confidence or resources</li>
				<li>A desire to accelerate results</li>
				<li>A lack of clarity with choices to be made</li>
				<li>Success has started to become problematic</li>
				<li>Work and life are out of balance, creating unwanted consequences</li>
				<li>Core strengths need to be identified, along with how best to leverage them</li>
			</ul>
